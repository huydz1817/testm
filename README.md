python3 network_stress_tester.py -t 192.168.1.1 -p 80 --test-types mixed --threads 10 --duration 30

# TCP SYN flood (requires root)
sudo python3 network_stress_tester.py -t 192.168.1.1 -p 80 --test-types tcp_syn --threads 20

# ICMP flood with custom packet size
sudo python3 network_stress_tester.py -t 192.168.1.1 --test-types icmp --packet-size 1500 --threads 15

# High-intensity multi-protocol test
sudo python3 network_stress_tester.py -t 192.168.1.1 -p 80 --test-types udp tcp_syn icmp --threads 25 --pps 2000
```

## üß† Educational Concepts

### Network Congestion Mechanics

This tool demonstrates several key network concepts:

#### 1. Bandwidth Saturation (UDP Flood)
- **Concept**: Overwhelming available bandwidth with data
- **Effect**: Legitimate traffic experiences delays and packet loss
- **Real-world**: Video streaming degradation, file transfer slowdowns

#### 2. Connection Exhaustion (TCP SYN Flood)
- **Concept**: Consuming server connection resources
- **Effect**: Server cannot accept new legitimate connections
- **Real-world**: Web server becomes unresponsive to new users

#### 3. Processing Overhead (ICMP Flood)
- **Concept**: Forcing target to process many small requests
- **Effect**: CPU and network stack become overwhelmed
- **Real-world**: Router/switch performance degradation

### WiFi-Specific Impacts

WiFi networks are particularly vulnerable to these attacks because:

1. **Shared Medium**: All devices compete for the same radio spectrum
2. **Half-Duplex**: Cannot send and receive simultaneously
3. **Collision Domain**: Interference affects all connected devices
4. **Limited Bandwidth**: Typically much lower than wired connections

### Performance Bottlenecks

Common bottlenecks this tool can help identify:

- **Router/AP Processing Power**: CPU limitations handling packet processing
- **Network Interface Limits**: Maximum packets per second capabilities  
- **Buffer Overflow**: Queue saturation causing packet drops
- **Protocol Stack Overhead**: OS networking layer performance limits

## üõ°Ô∏è Defensive Measures

Understanding these attacks helps implement proper defenses:

### Network-Level Protections
- **Rate Limiting**: Restrict packets per second from single sources
- **SYN Cookies**: Mitigate TCP SYN flood attacks
- **ICMP Rate Limiting**: Reduce ICMP processing overhead
- **Traffic Shaping**: Prioritize legitimate traffic

### Infrastructure Hardening
- **Firewall Rules**: Block suspicious traffic patterns
- **Intrusion Detection**: Monitor for attack signatures
- **Load Balancing**: Distribute traffic across multiple servers
- **DDoS Protection**: Cloud-based mitigation services

## üî¨ Research Applications

### Network Performance Research
- Measuring WiFi performance under stress
- Analyzing congestion control algorithms
- Testing Quality of Service (QoS) implementations

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Safety and Ethical Guidelines

### Authorized Testing Only
- Only test networks you own or have explicit permission to test
- Obtain written authorization before testing third-party networks
- Respect network policies and terms of service
- Consider impact on other network users

### Responsible Disclosure
- Report vulnerabilities through proper channels
- Allow reasonable time for fixes before public disclosure
- Provide constructive feedback to network operators
- Document findings for educational purposes

### Rate Limiting Recommendations
- Start with low packet rates (100-1000 pps)
- Monitor target system resources
- Use duration limits to prevent extended outages
- Have emergency stop procedures ready

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Permission Denied Errors**
```bash
# Solution: Run with sudo for raw sockets
sudo python3 network_stress_tester.py ...
```

**Scapy Import Errors**
```bash
# Solution: Install scapy
pip3 install scapy
# or
sudo apt-get install python3-scapy
```

**High CPU Usage**
```bash
# Solution: Reduce thread count or add rate limiting
--threads 5 --pps 1000
```

**Network Unreachable**
```bash
# Solution: Verify target IP and network connectivity
ping 192.168.1.1
```

### Performance Optimization

- Use rate limiting to prevent system overload
- Adjust thread count based on system capabilities
- Monitor system resources during testing
- Use appropriate packet sizes for test objectives
