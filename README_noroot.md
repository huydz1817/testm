‚úÖ **Works with standard user privileges**  
‚úÖ **No sudo/administrator access needed**  
‚úÖ **Still creates significant network stress**  
‚úÖ **Portable across different systems**  
‚úÖ **Safer for educational environments**  

## üìã Available Stress Testing Methods

### 1. UDP Flood (`udp`) - **Most Effective for Bandwidth Saturation**
- **How it works**: Uses standard UDP sockets (no raw sockets needed)
- **Effect**: Saturates network bandwidth with high-volume packet flooding
- **WiFi Impact**: Causes severe congestion, packet loss, and performance degradation
- **Why no root needed**: Uses `socket.SOCK_DGRAM` instead of raw sockets

```bash
# High-intensity UDP flood
python3 network_stress_tester_noroot.py -t 192.168.1.1 -p 80 --test-types udp --threads 20 --pps 3000
```

### 2. TCP Connection Flood (`tcp_connect`) - **Connection Exhaustion**
- **How it works**: Creates real TCP connections (full 3-way handshake)
- **Effect**: Exhausts server connection resources and file descriptors
- **WiFi Impact**: Overloads router connection tables, affects all devices
- **Advantage**: Works through firewalls and NAT

```bash
# TCP connection exhaustion
python3 network_stress_tester_noroot.py -t 192.168.1.1 -p 80 --test-types tcp_connect --threads 25
```

### 3. System Ping Flood (`ping`) - **Latency Spike Generation**
- **How it works**: Uses system `ping` command via subprocess
- **Effect**: Creates processing overhead and latency spikes
- **WiFi Impact**: Consumes router CPU, increases response times
- **Cross-platform**: Works on Windows, Linux, and macOS

```bash
# Ping flood for latency testing
python3 network_stress_tester_noroot.py -t 192.168.1.1 --test-types ping --threads 15 --pps 500
```

### 4. HTTP Request Flood (`http`) - **Application Layer Stress**
- **How it works**: Sends rapid HTTP GET requests to web servers
- **Effect**: Tests application-layer performance and server capacity
- **WiFi Impact**: Creates realistic web traffic load patterns
- **Realistic**: Simulates actual user traffic

```bash
# HTTP application stress
python3 network_stress_tester_noroot.py -t 192.168.1.1 -p 80 --test-types http --threads 30
```

### 5. Mixed Protocol (`mixed`) - **Comprehensive Testing**
- **How it works**: Randomly combines all above methods
- **Effect**: Creates realistic mixed-traffic scenarios
- **WiFi Impact**: Tests network under varied load conditions
- **Research Value**: Most representative of real-world conditions

```bash
# Mixed protocol comprehensive test
python3 network_stress_tester_noroot.py -t 192.168.1.1 -p 80 --test-types mixed --threads 20 --duration 60
```
